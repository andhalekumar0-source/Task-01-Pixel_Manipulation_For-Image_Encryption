# Task-01-Pixel_Manipulation_For-Image_Encryption
A simple Python tool that encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation. It changes pixel RGB values with a secret key, making the image unreadable until decrypted. Uses Pillow and NumPy for secure, fast, and reversible image encryption.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **image encryption** using basic mathematical pixel operations. By changing the RGB values of each pixel with a user-defined key, the image becomes unreadable. The process can be reversed to get back the original image using the same key.

## ⚙️ Features

- Encrypt and decrypt images using pixel value manipulation.
- Supports multiple image formats (.jpg, .png, .jpeg).
- Simple command-line interface.
- Lightweight and fast — perfect for learning cryptographic basics.
